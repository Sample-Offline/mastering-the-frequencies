                    A lot of the vocal qualities can be found within this part of the spectrum. If boosted too much, a lot of speech elements are covered up or otherwise made indistinguishable. In a lot of music, it is important for the vocals to be clear and stand out.
                </p>
                <p><strong><em>A helpful trick is to dip this area in other instruments, but boost by a few dB on the vocals. This will maintain the power and volume of the instruments while keeping a nice level for the vocals; without sacrificing clarity.</em></p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It is important to listen to the mix at a low-moderately low level when making adjustments.</li>
        <li>When EQing, it is a good idea to <strong>attenuate</strong>, or cut, the frequency first; instead of boosting.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Generally, lowering the <strong><a href="#glossary-gain">gain</a></strong> makes things louder, while raising the gain warps the sound.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <p>the SI unit of frequency, equal to one cycle per second.</p>
            <p>The hertz (symbol: Hz) is the derived unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI) and is defined as one cycle per second.[1] It is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves.</p>
            <p>Some of the unit's most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones, particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications. It is also used to describe the clock speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven. The units are sometimes also used as a representation of energy, via the photon energy equation (E=hÎ½), with one hertz equivalent to h joules.</p>
